        When enabled the firmware builds a minimal application focused on the
        MAX30100 sensor. Only the I2C bus and the sensor driver are
        initialised and the application periodically prints the heart rate
        readings to the console. Disable this option to build the full EMS
        firmware.

    range 10 5000
    default 10
    help
        Delay between consecutive sensor reads when the MAX30100 test
        application is enabled. Lower values provide faster updates but may
        produce more console output.
